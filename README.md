## Executive Summary

Modern Internet Data Centers (IDCs) form the backbone infrastructure for a vast array of computational workloads, encompassing everything from traditional batch processing to advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) training and inference tasks. These workloads are highly diverse in their resource demands, execution patterns, and scheduling behaviors, presenting substantial challenges for efficient resource management and consistent Quality of Service (QoS) delivery.

**Current IDC infrastructures** often utilize static resource allocation policies. This approach leads to critical inefficiencies, including:

- **Resource underutilization**
- **QoS violations**
- **Scheduling bottlenecks**

The rise of AI workloads has further complicated the landscape by introducing GPU-intensive tasks with complex communication patterns (e.g., via RDMA networks) and unpredictable execution durations.
